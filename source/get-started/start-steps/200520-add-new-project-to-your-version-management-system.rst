Add your new project to version management system
=================================================

It is useful to have the project under version management
*********************************************************
It is a good idea to use GitHub or Subversion for managing project source code, if commercial setting allows it.
The benefits are:
* Constant backup of your work.
* Easy to transfer code from development computer to another.
* Tracking what was changed, when and by whom.
* It is possible to get help with projects, even in private repository.


Protecting confidential information
***********************************
Often some parts of projects contain intellectual property which cannot be published. 
In this case private repository is a must, either on your business server or on GitHub.
* .gitignore can be used to keep confidential only in local computer.
