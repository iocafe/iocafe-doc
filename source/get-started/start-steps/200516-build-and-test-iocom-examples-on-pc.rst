Build and test IOCOM examples on Linux or Windows
=================================================

To make sure that everything works, one can build gina and frank examples, start both of these and see from command line 
output that they start communication. Both examples are in /coderoot/iocom/examples directory.

The ispy can be used to connect to frank example to provide simple UI. It is started by ispy.sh or ispy.bat in 
/coderoot/iocom/extensions/iocompython/examples/ispy directory. It is Python program and requires Kivy library.
