How automatic device number is allocated?
============================================
Device sets it's number to 10000 

Receive

If I receive 10000 and this is not auto enumerated device

* if connection doesn't have autoid, make one >10000, not used?
* change 10000 to autoid

Send

If I send > 10000

* if mblk id matches autoid, change to 10000
