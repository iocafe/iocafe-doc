How automatic device number is allocated
Device sets it's number to 10000 

Receive

If I receive 10000 and this is not auto enumerated device
  - if connection doesn't have autoid, make one >10000, not used?
  - change 10000 to autoid

Send

If I send > 10000
  - if mblk id matches autoid, change to 10000
