GLFW on Windows 
==============================================

The GLFW library comes prebuild for 32 bit Windows (i386 architecture) 
and for 64 bit Windows (AMD64 architecture).

- Headers for prebuilt GLFW are in /coderoot/bluetree/egui/dependencies/windows/include/GL directory.
- Prebuilt 32 bit GLFW libraries glfw32.lib and glfw32d.lib are in /coderoot/bluetree/egui/dependencies/windows/lib_win32_vs directory. 
- Prebuilt 64 bit GLFW library glfw32.lib and glfw32d.lib are in /coderoot/bluetree/egui/dependencies/windows/lib_win64_vs directory. 
- The debug library has 'd' at end of name, release library does not.

If you need to rebuild glfw, refer to GLFW documentation.
