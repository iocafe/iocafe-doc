imgui 
==============================================

Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that
you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline-enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic, and
self-contained (no external dependencies). The imgui library is high quality work by ocornut, who has invested ten 
years of work on it.

Selected imgui source code files have been readily copied into egui project.
