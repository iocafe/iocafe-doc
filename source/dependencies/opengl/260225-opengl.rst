OpenGL library
==============================================

OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-language, cross-platform API 
for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.

Unlike GLEW (which loads functions) and GLFW (which creates windows), 
OpenGL itself is the thing that actually draws the pixels on your screen. 
Think of it this way:

- GLFW: Creates the window and handles input- The easel and canvas
- OpenGL: Does the actual drawing	- The paint and brushes
- GLEW: Loads modern OpenGL functions	- The instruction manual for
  advanced techniques What OpenGL Actually Does

At its core, OpenGL is a state machine that provides hundreds of 
functions for graphics programming:

1. Drawing Primitives
2. Vertex and Fragment Processing
3. Texturing
4. Transformations
5. Lighting and Materials
6. Blending and Transparency


On linux, installation of OpenGL library: If you are specifically targeting
OpenGL for Embedded Systems (OpenGL ES), for example on mobile or embedded
devices, there are separate packages like libgles2-mesa-dev. 
But for standard desktop OpenGL development on Ubuntu, the libgl1-mesa-dev 
package is the correct starting point.

::

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev


It could be also, but I have not tried this:

::
  
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libgl-dev


Windows Visual Studio 2026 seems to contain openGL, ready for use.
