Dependencies
============

The eosal, iocom, pins and egui libraries depend on other libraries,
for example mbedTLS for network security, libjpeg for compression,
python for building iocom python module, imgui for graphic user interface, etc.

These libraries come with Apache or MIT style licensing, similar to iocafe 
libraries. Final application can be built royalty free, allowing
use in both open source and propriatery projects.
