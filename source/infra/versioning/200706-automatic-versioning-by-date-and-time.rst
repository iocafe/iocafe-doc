Automatic version numbers by date and time
===========================================

Iocafe convention: version numbers are simply date/time of latest build in YYMMDD-HHMM format. 
This allows automatic version number generation and ensures that I do not forget to change the
version number. This format sorting versions to time order, selecting newest version of
a specific package and matching installation package code to sources in git repository. 
This is only a convention, feel free to use other king of versioning.
Downsides on date/time based versioning are that version numbers are "longish" and major
and minor versions are not separated.
