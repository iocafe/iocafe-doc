Application infrastructure
===========================

The application infrastructure is a blueprint how application infrastructure can be organized
for development computer and for end user installation. This chapter giver overview how these
topics can be managed. This is intended as starting point or example, to get this stuff to work
more or less like "out of box". Real project's often have specific needs or existing code base
which take precedence, thus you may well want to organize directories, etc, differently and write
new scripts to manage your project. 

* Application network topology, cloud and security
* Web user interfaces, user interface apps
* Installation packages, software updates and versioning.
* Directory tree organization.
* Scripts to automate development tasks.
* Starting device software at boot
