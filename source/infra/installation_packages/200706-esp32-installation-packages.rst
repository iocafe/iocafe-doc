ESP32 installation packages
============================

An ESP32 installation package is simply one executable binary file (generated by compiler/linker).
By default the PlatformIO build generates binary file named firmware.bin.

Conventions, iocafe
*********************
The firmware.bin which needs to be renamed so that the file name includes the IO 
application name, program version and the target architecture. Convention used by us is to
keep all installation packages in subdirecroties under /coderoot/packages directory. 
I make version numbers simply by YYMMDD-HHMM. This allows sorting versions to time order 
and selecting newest one. Convention of naming debian packages as 
organization-application-versiondate-versiontime-architecture.deb enables meaningfull 
searches. For example to find newest available package for application "candy" 
running on "esp32" architecture.

Creating a ESP32 installation package
**************************************

* Version number files generated at build time.
* Firmware.bin is moved to /coderoot/packages and renamed.

To do/consider
***************

* Since the "ESP32 installation package" is simply the executable binary, it could be tampered with and modified
  version loaded. We should add cryptographic signatures to the file, setup some chain of trust and check the 
  validity of digital signature when installing.
