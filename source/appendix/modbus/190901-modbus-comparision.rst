MODBUS comparison
====================
The library is an alternative to MODBUS protocol for point to point communication. Since the MODBUS
is well known, it is easy to get the general idea by listing the main differences between the protocols:

* The IOCOM is event based, while MODBUS uses polling. This means that data is transferred when it 
  changes, not when it is queried.
* Data transfers are synchronized in way that it guarantees that other end of communication receives 
  changes in same order the changes are made. 
* IOCOM uses compression, flow control, etc and aims for performance. This makes it more complex than
  MODBUS. While most MODBUS users write their own protocol implementation, I do not expect this to work
  well with IOCOM. I recommend using reference implementation, at least as starting point, unless there
  is need to port the protocol to Python, Java, etc. 
* IOCOM requires full duplex serial communication (at least logically), half duplex will not do. 
  It cannot do “one master – multiple slaves” serial communication, every device needs it’s own serial
  wire. If those features are important, then use MODBUS. It was designed specifically for that scenario
  and does it well.
* When needed, IOCOM handles secure TLS connections natively. MODBUS is channeled trough SSH to provide
  secure connection. SSH is typically too heavy for micro controllers, while many more powerful ones
  can use TLS.
