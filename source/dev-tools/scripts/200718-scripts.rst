Scripts
========
Many common development tasks are be automated using scripts: Conversion of JSON files to C code,
or to compressed binary files, merging JSONs, copying source code to Arduino style directory structure, etc.
Most these scripts are written in Python. These scripts themselves contain conventions about directory and 
file names, version string format, etc. You may need to modify or rewrite these scripts to use different
conventions.
