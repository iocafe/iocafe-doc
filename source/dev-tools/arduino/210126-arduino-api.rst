Arduino API and IDE
====================
Over the years arduino API has expanded as "de facto" API to microcontrollers and development boards 
from many manufacturers. In addition to original Arduino boards, the API is supported SMT32 chips as 
stmduino, Teensy developer boards as teensyduino and is supported for ESP32. 

Even standardization is far from perfect and we end up with some HW specific stuff, it is generally 
easy and clear API to use. Best widely accepted effort in standardization of wild west of microcontrollers.

Most popular two development environments for Arduino API are the original Arduino IDE and 
Visual Studio Code + PlatformIO. PlatformIO is more advanced of the two, includes debuggings,
etc. Arduino IDE is simpler to use. This chapter is mostly about the Arduino IDE.
