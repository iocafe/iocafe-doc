================================

Now that we have our basic skeleton,
let's document the project.
As you might have guessed from the name,
we'll be documenting a basic web crawler.

For this project,
we'll have the following pages:

* Index Page
* Support
* Installation
* Cookbook
* Command Line Options
* API

Let's go over the concepts we'll cover,
and then we can talk more about the pages to create.
