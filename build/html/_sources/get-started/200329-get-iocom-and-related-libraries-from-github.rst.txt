Get IOCOM and related libraries
===========================================

NOTICE: WE ARE IN PROCESS OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT. THE TEXT BELOW IS ONLY A PLAN HOW TO DEAL WITH STABLE VERSIONS 
ONCE WE GET THE FIRST IOCOM RELEASE PUBLISHED. 

Stable versions
***************
If your goal is to create IO application, use stable version. If there is one for your hardware and development environment. 
The stable versions will be marked by github tags. If there is none, please email me pekka.lehtikoski@iocafe.org.


Latest version
**************
The latest version should be used if you participate in development of IOCOM or another related library. 
If your goal is to create IO device application, latest code from "master" is likely to bring you unwelcome issues.


Place library source code in /coderoot directory
************************************************
At least for now, the library development has been done under directory /coderoot. I strongly recommend to do so,
since using other paths is untested and would require modifications to build, etc, scripts. 

.. code-block:: shell

   cd /
   sudo mkdir coderoot
   sudo chown <yourusername> coderoot

On windows create directory c:\coderoot


Get Git
************************************************
You need Git, if you have not it already. On Debian Linux:

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo apt install git


Clone the iocom, eosal and pins libraries
************************************************
Clone the library code: 

.. code-block:: shell

   cd /coderoot
   git clone https://github.com/iocafe/iocom.git
   git clone https://github.com/iocafe/eosal.git
   git clone https://github.com/iocafe/pins.git

You should get someting like tree below under /coderoot

.. code-block:: text
