Test your new application on Linux or Windows
=============================================

It is a lot easier

Build
***************
If your goal is to create IO application, use stable version. If there is one for your hardware and development environment. 
The stable versions will be marked by github tags. If there is none, please email me pekka.lehtikoski@iocafe.org.

Test communication
********************
The latest version should be used if you participate in development of IOCOM or another related library. 
If your goal is to create IO device application, latest code from "master" is likely to bring you unwelcome issues.
