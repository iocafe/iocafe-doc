Alternative 2, add IOCOM API calls to your existing application
===============================================================

Often it is desirable to use iocom as library, without supporting framework. 

Stable versions
***************
If your goal is to create IO application, use stable version. If there is one for your hardware and development environment. 
The stable versions will be marked by github tags. If there is none, please email me pekka.lehtikoski@iocafe.org.
